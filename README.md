### Developer Note
I created this game because I wanted it to be easily shared and played on both phones and desktops without prior instalation, so a website became my choice.

The menu is based on real food you can find in Blok M, Jakarta. If you get the chance, definitely check it out!

Honestly, during development I often thought about changing the penguin to another character because I couldn’t remember why I picked it in the first place (sorry, penguin). But in the end, I think the penguin works just fine.
